 * 191	Number of 1 Bits
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/
 * 
 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 * For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
